# Arduino Car Telemetery
## About Project
This project was created as a term project for my Physical Computing class at Carleton University. The project is designed to capture data coming from a vehicle and transmitted to a computer that displays and logs the incoming data. Data is captured by an Arduino and is then transmitted to another Arduino connected to a computer through the use of a 2.4Ghz transeiver. A python application interprets the information and displays it using MatPlotLib, the data is also logged to a local file in CSV format.
